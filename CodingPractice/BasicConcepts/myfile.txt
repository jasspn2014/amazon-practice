Remember the climax scene of the blockbuster Hindi movie '3 Idiots'? It was shot at the Pangong Tso. The movie was so popular in China that fans there celebrated 10 years of '3 Idiots' in December 2019, hailing it as the 'film of the century'.

Right now, this Pangong Tso is the site of eye-to-eye confrontation between Indian and Chinese troops, following a scuffle in early May. Both sides have ramped up their troop presence but "disengagement" process is also underway.

The Lieutenant General-level talks are scheduled for June 6. Though current theatre of military tension also includes Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie, focus of the India-China border dispute is likely to be on Pangong Tso.
